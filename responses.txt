Ganymede, around Jupiter
Titan, around Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
The Kuiper belt
Ceres
Eris the biggest, and second Pluto
Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune 
Ganymede, Europa, Io and Callisto
The Oort cloud
The Andromeda Galaxy M31
The Large and Small Magellanic clouds
Proxima centaury, 4.2 light-year aways
It's the hot remaining inner core of a medium-size star after the red giant blowed its gas.
It's an extremely dense object that can result of the supernova for heavy stars
They are resulting from the biggest supernovae
Hydrogen (75%) and Helium (25%)
It comes from billions of comets who impacted the Earth so far
Around 300 billion !
Around 200 billion !
Probably around a million of billion of billion !! (10^24)
Around 6000 °C
The massive stars (blue and red supergiants)
The small cold stars (red dwarfs)
Around 5 billion years, but it will swallow the Earth before.
They are cloud of gas where sometimes the gas gather to create new stars
They are tiny galaxies of a few millions stars, orbiting around the milky way.
They are clusters of a few thousands stars inside bigger galaxies.
it is red-shifted 
The Hubble law
Cassegrain (eye piece on the bottom) and Newton (eye piece on the side)
Around 8 minutes
Around 1.3 seconds
Almost 10 thousand !
Sputnik (USSR) in 1957
Yuri Gagarin (USSR) in 1961
Neil Armstrong for Apollo 11, on July 21st 1969
Mount Olympus on Mars (72 000 feet !!!)
Io, around Jupiter
It's a giant storm, with the diameter of the Earth
It's mainly the InfraRed spectrum
5 (+1 prototype) : Challenger, Discovery, Columbia, Endeavour, Atlantis (+ Enterprise)
The Saturn 5
The MIR station (1986-2001)
It's something that we can't detect but has to explain why galaxies spin faster than expected
It's deformation of space-time occurring when two massive objects merge
It's a block of ice and rock, melting when it gets closer to the sun
It's when the Moon comes in between the Earth and the Sun
It's when the Earth comes in between the Moon and the Sun
Sagittarius A*
110 objects
New General Catalog
Voyager 1
Triton
Only 300 feet thick !
Cassini (+ Huygens for Titan)
Curiosity and Perseverance 
3 days (one way)
We measure the wavelength with at the emission intensity pic
Hotter. Red stars are colder.
Certain wavelength only. It depends on the atoms, inside the hot gas.
Over a continuous spectrum because the reflect the large spectrum of stars.
It's continuous, expected at some wavelength which are absorbed by the cold gas
The atmospheric turbulences 
Around 100 thousand light-years
It's slightly accelerating
Gravitational assist : the probe goes close to heavy planets to then be catapulted out
Astronomers observe the orbited star, looking for variation if the brightness or spinning speed
90 times the pressure on the Earth's surface !
92 (with 4 main)
Ice Water, that can be used for Fuel or sustaining life in a colony
Because of tidal effects, who slowly decrease the relative spinning speed of the Moon
Yes, the higher the magnitude, the lower the brightness. Negative magnitude means very bright
An elliptical galaxy
Methane (and Ethane) 
Nothing. It has to be at least 20 feet for a small part to touch the ground
1300 times !! Jupiter's radius is 11 times Earth's radius
1.3 million !! Sun's radius in 110 times Earth's radius
The ecliptic plan
Mainly the Moon, but also the Sun
Those moons are suspected to have a underground ocean, with plums, interesting for life 
Sirius, Canopus, Alpha Centauri, Arcturus, Vega … (and sometimes Ginny when she is not spicy ;) )
They can only be created during supernovae
Only the accretion disk around supermassive black holes or quasar
It lets the telescope see through dust clouds
